## TaskTracker 2 by George Karmelich

When a user first reaches the homepage, they have the option to either log in with their email or create an account.
If they choose to create an account, they have to provide a name and email address.  If either of these are missing,
an error message appears indicating what went wrong and an account is not created.

Once a user is logged in, they are taken to the taks homepage (My Tasks) where they can create a new task or edit existing tasks.
Also, at the banner, there are buttons with other directories a user can access. The Task Directory shows a list of all tasks in 
the application, with all relevant information.  The staff directory shows all users in the application.  Here, managers cna add
users to there staff, which then makes them their manager. 

There is also an option to edit your own profile, which allows users to make changes to their profile as well as view their 
manager and staff.  Finally, there is a log out button which closes the application and returns to the application homepage.
